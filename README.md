# Maze Solver Project

## Description

This project is an implementation of a maze solver algorithm using the A* algorithm. The goal of the project is to provide a solution to traversing and solving mazes efficiently.

### Project Features:

- **Maze Generation:** Create random mazes of varying sizes and complexities.
- **Solver Algorithm:** A* (A-star)
- **Customization:** Customize maze generation parameters, such as maze size, complexity, and solver options.
